# Jobspot-Jobseeking-Kotlin_App

Our job finder app addresses one of the most pressing economic problems in Sri Lanka, which is unemployment. The app provides an all-inclusive solution for job seekers to connect with potential employers, enabling them to search for jobs based on their skills and preferences and apply for them directly through the app. By streamlining the job search process, 
our app can significantly reduce the time job seekers spend searching for jobs and increase their chances of finding employment.
